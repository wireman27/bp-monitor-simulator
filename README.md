### Backround

I was intrigued by how blood pressure is measured using modern-day devices. After getting acquainted with the basic principles, I wanted to challenge myself to try to create a barebones simulation of the basic mechanisms of measuring blood pressure.

I ended up creating essentially a (fairly buggy) particle collision system with collapsing and expanding walls.

I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create the simulation.

### Run

`python3 -m http.server` and then open `localhost:8000` in your browser.
